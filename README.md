# Real-Time Speaker Identification using Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time speaker identification using machine learning and Python. The goal is to identify and distinguish between speakers in an audio stream based on their voice characteristics. The system is designed to work with both pre-recorded and live audio, offering a robust solution for applications that require speaker recognition.

## Key Skills and Technologies
- **Machine Learning** for speaker identification
- **Audio Processing** using Python libraries (e.g., librosa)
- **Real-Time Data Handling** for continuous speaker identification
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and model testing

## Features
- **Speaker Identification:** Real-time identification of speakers from audio files.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature extraction from audio signals.
- **Model Training:** Using classification models to recognize individual speakers.
